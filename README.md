# nest-magnetism-toolkit

A toolkit of code that is useful for various aspects of modelling magnetic devices and materials, developed and designed by members of the NEST group at the University of Manchester

##Components

Various tools have been designed and can be used separately. Examples of use are available for each.  

### Energy barriers, coercivity and demagnetising factors

The /Energy-Barriers_Coercivity_Demag/ folder contains a routines written in Matlab that can be used to calculate the energy barrier, coercivity and demagnetising factors of magnetic islands, either single layer or bilayer exchange coupled composites. A number of examples of use are also included, which also detail how to combine the routines to describe more complex systems. Details of how to use these examples are contained in the [wiki](https://github.com/nest-manchester/nest-magnetism-toolkit/wiki). These routines also form the basic building blocks of the [statistical_BPM_write_error_model](https://github.com/nest-manchester/statistical_BPM_write_error_model).
